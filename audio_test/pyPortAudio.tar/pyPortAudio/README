This directory contains the Python wrappers to PortAudio.

This wrapper written by David McNab <david@freenet.org.nz>

PortAudio written by many good folk, info at
www.portaudio.com

When you unpack this Python package, you should place this
directory at the top level of your PortAudio build tree, next
to all the other directories such as 'pablio', 'pa_common' etc.

Note that this Python wrapper features the ability to read in
encoded sound files, such as WAV files. For this, libsndfile
is required. Refer to www.freenet.org.nz/python/pyPortAudio to
get a pre-built binary copy of libsndfile for windoze if you
need to.
